# Terminal Assistant

This is a fun little Python project I made to help me learn programming.  
It runs in the terminal and can:
- Tell jokes
- Tell the current time
- Do basic calculations (like adding two numbers)
- Counts down! (Still broken, now takes intigers but doesn't count down)

I made it just for fun and learning, but feel free to check it out or give feedback!
